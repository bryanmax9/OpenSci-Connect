# CollabSpace: Nasa International Space Apps Challenge

## ðŸš€ About the Team

Welcome to the **ScriptSages**!

At our core, we are more than just software developers. We are a passionate group of open-source advocates, forward-thinking innovators, and problem-solvers. Our deep understanding of the challenges in the open science community has led us to create a revolutionary solution. Our platform, CollabSpace, is not just a networking toolâ€”it's a catalyst for transformative scientific collaborations.

**Our Vision:** A thriving marketplace for open science projects, where project creators can seamlessly find the skilled talent they need, and contributors can find meaningful projects to support.

## ðŸŒŒ About the Challenge

The open science community is flooded with projects and potential contributors. However, a major bottleneck exists: the difficulty in efficiently connecting project creators with apt contributors. Our solution, developed for the Nasa International Space Apps Challenge, aims to bridge this gap, creating a platform where open-source innovation flourishes.

## ðŸ’» Installation and Running Instructions

1. **Setting up the environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install django
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

If working with an IP or API(NASA API) (e.g., for making requests):

```bash
pip install django
```

## Instructions

1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. Setting up a User Account:
   To create a superuser account:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   After creation, visit the path /admin to access the admin panel.

3. Git Commands for Collaboration:
   Pushing changes to a branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin your_branch_name
   ```
   Post-push, switch back to the main branch:

```bash
 git checkout main
```

Pulling changes from a branch:

```bash
 git pull origin branch_name
```

## ðŸŒ  Project Highlights

- Web-based Solution: Developed using the Django template, our platform is user-friendly, allowing easy account setups, skill-project matching, and integrated messaging.
- NASA Integration: We've incorporated NASA's APIs such as APOD, EPIC, and Mars rover images to motivate users and enhance the platform's appeal.
- AI-Powered Recommendations: Our platform uses scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, to offer users personalized project recommendations based on their profiles and preferences.
- Rapid Development: Our choice of Django for both frontend and backend ensured we could build a robust solution within the limited timeframe of the hackathon.
